#Tech #Fight #COVID #19

Summary:

Public repo for open source contributors to fight against COVID-19, together as an IT community ! There is of course no license or restrictions for this repo

The idea is to encourage all to be able to volunteer, so we can help out our medical industry colleagues (who will be working tirelessly on this initiative)

Initial Meeting Details: TBD
